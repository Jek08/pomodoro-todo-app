# Pomodoro and Todo List
## Manage your time and tasks

Pomodoro is a productivity tool application which many people find helpful. 
It basically set up the time for working and the time for taking a break. 
Each period of working will be counted as one pomodoro, so users can see how much productivity they have achieved.
Because the common usage of pomodoro timer is to finish tasks, this app also has a todo list which user can add tasks and mark them as finished.
User can also access the finished task from the task archive. As every task is a hard work, a motivational message will be shown when there is no more task.

This project uses React 18.x and Bootstrap 5.x. 
The app built upon MVVM architecture by the support from React Class Component and OOP concepts from Typescript.
